Tired of starting and ending your time recorder each time? Annoyed of forgetting to toggling your time recorder?
This is the app for you. This is a small, silent app for recording your work time and guaranteeing you an immersive work experience.

# How it works?

The timer regularly check whether you're clicking or typing. If no action is detected, a 10-minutes countdown will be triggered. The countdown would stop once any action are made. When the countdown ends, it will stop recording the work time until you come back.

To exclude the time you are using your computer but not for working. the timer also check the window's name of the current active window. If you are not watching your "work window", the count down will be triggered even though you are clicking or typing. What windows are "work window"? You define them!
